Then, create a SQLITE database or use an existing database and create a table in the database called "Ages":

CREATE TABLE Ages ( 
  name VARCHAR(128), 
  age INTEGER
)
Then make sure the table is empty by deleting any rows that you previously inserted, and insert these rows and only these rows with the following commands:

DELETE FROM Ages;
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Angelina', 15);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Iana', 32);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Ikechukwu', 13);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Lauryn', 34);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Jodie', 21);


Once the inserts are done, run the following SQL command:
SELECT hex(name || age) AS X FROM Ages ORDER BY X
